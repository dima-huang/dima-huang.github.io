My final work as a postdoctoral researcher at UT Austin has just been accepted by JACS and will soon be published online!
It has been a fun experience growing a bunch of crystals of MnCl<sub>2</sub>, CoCl<sub>2</sub>, NiCl<sub>2</sub>,
Mn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, and Co(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>
(unfortunately, Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> did not want to grow!),
and I finally concluded the experience under the guidance of Prof. Jonathan L. Sessler.<br>
Cheers! 🍻🍻
