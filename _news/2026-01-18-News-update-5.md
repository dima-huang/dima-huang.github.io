With the 2025 academic year now concluded, we can finally devote more focused attention to our research during the remaining winter break! ⛄❄️ Aside from surviving the teaching of Physical Chemistry and General Chemistry, I am deeply grateful for the generous support, guidance, and encouragement I have received from all those who made this possible—far more than I can adequately thank in words. As we look ahead, I wish everyone a productive, fulfilling, and successful Year of the Horse. 🐎🐎
