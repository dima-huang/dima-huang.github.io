I have a confession to make: I do enjoy coding and playing with code if time permits.
⌨That being said, I’m not cut out to be a programmer. That ship sailed years ago.
Building a website is absolutely strenuous if you don't want to pay subscription fees to those so-called "free" website builders.
(Trust me, I’ve tried.) Google Sites is okay, but I want to customize a lot of things.
The struggle is real, and cheers!🍺🍻🍺🍻</div>
