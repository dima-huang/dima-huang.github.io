Building a website is absolutely strenuous if you don't want to pay subscription
fees to those so-called "free" website builders or have their branding always
displayed on your site. Google Sites is okay, but yours truly is very picky and
wants to customize a lot of things. While AI is absolutely amazing at helping me
build this responsive website, the struggle is still very real. Cheers! 🍺🍻🍺🍻
