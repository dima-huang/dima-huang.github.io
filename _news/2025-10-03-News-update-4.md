Construction of the DH Lab has finally been completed, and it has now been registered with NCKU. Many thanks
to Peter Chen for his support, without which we could not have accomplished this so quickly. Everwin also
provided tremendous assistance throughout the process, and we are deeply grateful for their contribution.
I would also like to thank my students for their patience during the wait and for their help in facilitating
the process. Now the question remains—which chemical should we buy first?⚗️🧪⚗️🧪
