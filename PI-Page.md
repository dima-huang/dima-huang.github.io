Dr. Huang is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemistry,
Physical Chemistry Division, at NCKU. He earned his B.S. in Chemical Engineering
from NCKU in 2011 and his M.S. in Chemistry from NTU in 2013 under the
supervision of Professor Chao-Tsen Chen (陳昭岑). In 2016, he pursued a Ph.D.
in Chemistry at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, under the guidance
of Professor Valérie C. Pierre, and he graduated in 2021. After completing his
postdoctoral research with Professor Jonathan L. Sessler at the University of
Texas at Austin (2021–2025), he joined the Chemistry Department at NCKU.
