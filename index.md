**We study the separation science of critical materials.**
Our group develops sustainable methods to recover and separate critical
elements—those essential to modern technologies but are often scarce and difficult
to replace. We design selective receptors and functionalized materials to target
these elements, enabling efficient catch-and-release in heterogeneous systems.

In the lab, we design, synthesize, and evaluate ligands, and study
their immobilization onto materials such as polymers. Beyond organic
synthesis, we integrate physical, inorganic, and analytical chemistry
to address complex challenges—examining thermodynamics, growing
crystals, and conducting spectroscopic titrations. We also
collaborate with experts in computational chemistry and
electrochemistry to further our fundamental insights.
