critical materials</h2>
</div>
We aim to develop sustainable methods for recovering and
separating critical materials â€” elements that are vital to modern
technologies, yet are in limited supply and lack easy substitutes.
We design selective receptors and functionalized materials to target
these elements, enabling efficient catch-and-release in heterogeneous
systems.

Common critical materials seen in modern technology.

In the lab, we design, synthesize, and evaluate ligands, and study
their immobilization onto materials such as polymers. Beyond organic
synthesis, we integrate physical, inorganic, and analytical chemistry
to address complex challengesâ€”examining thermodynamics, growing
crystals, and conducting spectroscopic titrations. We also
collaborate with experts in computational chemistry and
electrochemistry to further our fundamental insights.
