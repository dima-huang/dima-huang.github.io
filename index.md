## Hello and welcome

The Dima Huang Lab develops sustainable methods for recovering and
separating critical materials — elements that are vital to modern
technologies, yet are in limited supply and lack easy substitutes.
We design selective receptors and receptor-functionalized materials
to target specific ions, enabling efficient catch-and-release in
heterogeneous systems. By using stimuli-responsive triggers (e.g.,
pH, electrochemical potential, or light), we optimize
reversible binding and minimize secondary waste, enhancing overall
sustainability.

In the lab, we design, synthesize, and evaluate ligands, and study
their immobilization onto materials such as polymers. Beyond organic
synthesis, we integrate physical, inorganic, and analytical chemistry
to address complex challenges—examining thermodynamics, growing
crystals, and conducting spectroscopic titrations. We also
collaborate with experts in computational chemistry and
electrochemistry to further our fundamental insights.
