## Hello and welcome

The Dima Huang Lab develops sustainable methods for recovering and
separating critical materials — elements that are vital to modern
technologies, yet are in limited supply and lack easy substitutes.
We design selective receptors and functionalized materials to target
these elements, enabling efficient catch-and-release in heterogeneous
systems.

In the lab, we design, synthesize, and evaluate ligands, and study
their immobilization onto materials such as polymers. Beyond organic
synthesis, we integrate physical, inorganic, and analytical chemistry
to address complex challenges—examining thermodynamics, growing
crystals, and conducting spectroscopic titrations. We also
collaborate with experts in computational chemistry and
electrochemistry to further our fundamental insights.
