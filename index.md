## Hello and welcome

The Dima Huang Lab has a strong interest in developing sustainable recovery and separation methods for critical materials - elements that face high supply risks, are essential for modern technologies, and lack viable substitutes. Our research focuses on designing receptors and receptor-functionalized materials with high selectivity and binding affinity for these targeted ions. By immobilizing these receptors, we enable efficient catch-and-release mechanisms within heterogeneous phases, leveraging stimuli-responsive systems to achieve reversible binding. A key innovation lies in optimizing the release phase using external triggers (e.g., pH, electrochemical potential, or light), which reduces secondary waste generation and enhances process sustainability.

More importantly, perhaps, is what we actually do in the lab. We design, synthesize, and evaluate receptors and ligands, as well as study their immobilization onto suitable materials (e.g., polymers). In addition to organic synthesis, we employ a combination of physical, inorganic, and analytical chemistry to tackle complex problems. Specifically, we investigate thermodynamics, grow crystals, and perform spectroscopic titrations, among other techniques. Furthermore, we collaborate with other research groups specializing in computational chemistry or electrochemistry.
