description: "I enjoy hiking, tea, coffee, and the occasional “non-fattening”
snack. In truth, I probably devote more time to thinking about food than
chemistry—largely because nine out of ten of my scientific ideas tend to be non-starters,
whereas deciding what’s for dinner at least results in something useful."
