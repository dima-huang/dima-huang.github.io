Lab safety is taken very seriously in the DH Lab!
</h3>
Each member of the lab contributes to making safety our highest priority. By adhering to best practices,
we create a safe and productive environment for everyone. For additional guidance,
we encourage you to explore the [University of Minnesota’s Safety Moments website](https://www.jst.umn.edu/safety-moments),
an excellent resource for cultivating a strong culture of safety.

NMR-related

<h3 style="text-align: left;">
What are relaxation, CEST, spin-spin coupling, asymmetric satellite peaks, etc.?
</h3>
Dr. Glenn Facey retired from the University of Ottawa in 2020. During his tenure
at the NMR facility, he documented numerous common and interesting topics
related to NMR in his blog, many of which continue to be frequently referenced
today!

What about Multinuclear NMR?</h3>

NMR-active nuclei are those with a non-zero nuclear spin quantum number (I ≠ 0).
NMR spectroscopy is possible with almost any element of the periodic table,
but in practice, other factors must be considered, including natural abundance,
frequency ratio, and reference compound. The website maintained by
the [Institute of Chemistry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/nmr/techniques/1d/multi.html)
contains very useful information, presented in accordance with the periodic
table.

 MS-related

<h3 style="text-align: left;">
Do I have the correct MS spectra?</h3>

Ionized samples often form adducts in ESI-MS. These adducts may originate from
background sources (solvents, ionizing agents) or contaminants (plasticizers,
buffer components, syringe grease, etc.). Below are downloadable spreadsheets
listing:
