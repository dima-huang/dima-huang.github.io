Address challenges in critical materials separation
</h2>
**The overarching goal** of this research is to address the urgent need for sustainable
recovery of critical materialsâ€”elements essential to advanced electronics and chip
manufacturing. Central to the research program lies **the challenge of rethinking
the canonical design principles of extractants used in metallurgical processes**.
This effort stems from the poor selectivity of metal extractants when
separating neighboring elements, particularly in complex substrates such as
modern e-waste. Most extractants used in e-waste recycling target metal cations
while overlooking the role of counter anions. In material leachates, high
concentrations of anions (e.g., chloride, nitrate) often associate with
metal ions, affecting their apparent stability (Figure 1a). Meanwhile,
complexation within confined spaces can generate unique coordination modes with
unrecognized potential for separations (Figure 1b). We believe that receptors
exploiting these anion-metal interactions and spatially constrained complexation will
enhance selectivity in separations and reduce secondary waste generation.
The targeted elements include Li, Mn, Co, Ni, and the lanthanides (Ln).

Additionally, we aim to **explore novel mechanisms for achieving catch-and-release
of critical materials**. For quite some time, complexation and decomplexation of
bound ions have relied on pH modulation. While effective in some cases,
this approach constrains receptor design to ionic or amine-based scaffolds and
often fails to deliver sufficient selectivity among chemically similar elements.
Alternatives are needed. Stimuli-responsive receptors offer an attractive
solution by enabling distinct coordination modes in response to
external stimuli, thereby facilitating the catch-and-release of target ions
(Figure 1c). We believe that judiciously designed receptors of this kind will expand the
toolbox of extractants available to separation science.

On this basis, three projects are proposed and outlined as follows:
