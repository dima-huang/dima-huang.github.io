### We address challenges related to the separation of critical materials, as well as environmental remediation.
**The overarching goal** of this research is to meet the urgent need for sustainable
recovery of critical materials essential for advanced electronics and chip
manufacturing. Central to the research program is **the challenge of rethinking
the canonical design principles of extractants used in metallurgy**.
This effort is motivated by the poor selectivity of metal extractants when
separating neighboring elements, particularly in complex substrates such as
modern e-waste. The extractants currently used in most e-waste recycling
processes are typically designed to target metal cations. However, the role of
counter anions is often underappreciated. In material leachates, high
concentrations of anions (e.g., chloride, nitrate) are known to associate with
metal ions, affecting their apparent stability (Figure 1a). On the other hand,
complexation within confined spaces can generate unique coordination modes with
unrecognized potential for separations (Figure 1b). We believe that receptors
exploiting these anion-metal interactions and constrained complexation will
enhance selectivity in separations and reduce secondary waste generation.
The targeted elements include Li, Mn, Co, Ni, and the lanthanides (Ln).

Additionally, we aim to **explore novel mechanisms for achieving catch-and-release
of critical materials**. For quite some time, complexation and decomplexation of
bound ions have been achieved primarily through pH adjustments. However, this
strategy limits receptor designs to ionic or amine-based scaffolds and has
resulted in insufficient separation efficiencies between neighboring elements.
Alternatives are needed. Stimuli-responsive receptors are particularly appealing
because they enable different coordination modes to be mediated in response to
specific stimuli, thereby facilitating the catch-and-release of targeted ions
(Figure 1c). We believe that such receptors can expand the toolbox of receptor
designs relevant to separation sciences.

On this basis, three projects are proposed and outlined as follows:
1. Leveraging anion coordination for separations
2. Complexation in confined spaces
3. Stimuli-responsive receptors in extractive metallurgy
