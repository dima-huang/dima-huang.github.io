## **Hello and welcome**

The Dima Huang Lab has a strong interest in developing sustainable recovery and separation methods for critical materials - elements that face high supply risks, are essential for modern technologies, and lack viable substitutes. Our research focuses on designing receptors and receptor-functionalized materials with high selectivity and binding affinity for these targeted ions. By immobilizing these receptors, we enable efficient catch-and-release mechanisms within heterogeneous phases, leveraging stimuli-responsive systems to achieve reversible binding. A key innovation lies in optimizing the release phase using external triggers (e.g., pH, electrochemical potential, or light), which reduces secondary waste generation and enhances process sustainability.
